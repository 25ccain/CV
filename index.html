  <h3>Bio</h3>

  <p>School life: When I am at school, I enjoy learning new things. Some of my favorite classes are Ceramics, World Geography,Explore Computer Science, Science and English. I think highly of respect, and everyone should be respected no matter what. I
    can be usually found hanging out with friends and studying. I have always loved learning and being at school. And I stray away from getting into fights and do my work/homework. Thats my school life in a nutshell.</p>
  <p>Personal Life: I have lived in Layton, Utah my entire life. In my personal time I like to play video games with my friends. I also enjoy helping others in my neighborhood. I enjoy playing with my dog, and I also love to read books because books
    are awesome. And I like to play baseball with
    my teammates. I am a very hard-working person if I have my mind set on something I will accomplish it. Well yeah that’s basically my life in a nutshell.</p>
